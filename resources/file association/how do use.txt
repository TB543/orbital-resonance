to set up file association make sure you have the virtual enviornment in the correct place with the following file structure:

C:\Project
│
├── orbital-resonance
│   ├── resources
│   │   └── file association
│   │       └── orbital resonance.bat
│   ├── src
│   │   └── main.py
│
├── venv
│   └── Scripts
│       └── activate.bat

then right click on a .orbres file and select the following:
	Open with... -> More Apps -> Look for another app on this PC
make sure you check "Always use this app to open .orbres files" before clicking "Look for another app on this PC"
then navigate to the "orbital resonance.bat" file and select it
now every time you open a .orbres file, the program will automatically start with the selected file loaded
** note: this only works for windows **
